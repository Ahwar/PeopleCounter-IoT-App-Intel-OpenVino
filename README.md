## What it Does

The people counter application will demonstrate how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count. Send all calculated Stats and Output Image to the server using Mosca and FFmpeg server.

## How it Works

The counter will use the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit. The model used will be able to identify people in a video frame. The app should count the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame) and the total count of people. It then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho MQTT Python package.

## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

 refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html)
- [Mac](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_macos.html)
- [Windows](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_windows.html)

### Install Nodejs and its dependencies

refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](./linux-setup.md)
- [Mac](./mac-setup.md)
- [Windows](./windows-setup.md)

### Install npm

There are three components that need to be running in separate terminals for this application to work:

-   MQTT Mosca server 
-   Node.js* Web server
-   FFmpeg server
     
From the main directory:

* For MQTT/Mosca server:
   ```
   cd webservice/server
   npm install
   ```

* For Web server:
  ```
  cd ../ui
  npm install
  ```
  **Note:** If any configuration errors occur in mosca server or Web server while using **npm install**, use the below commands:
   ```
   sudo npm install npm -g 
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean
   npm config set registry "http://registry.npmjs.org"
   npm install
   ```

## What model to use
We used pretrained intel model from Intel OpenVino Model Zoo. i.e [person-detection-retail-0013](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html).  
To download use steps below.
You can also see [OpenVino Model Downloader Guide](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_tools_downloader_README.html#model_downloader_usage)  

go to model downloader script 

```
cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader
```
download `person-detection-retail-0013` model.
```
python downloader.py --name person-detection-retail-0013 -o [project_home_dir]/models/
```
now model is download at `[project_home_dir]/models/intel/`

## Run the application

From the main directory:

### Step 1 - Start the Mosca server

```
cd webservice/server/node-server
node ./server.js
```

You should see the following message, if successful:
```
Mosca server started.
```

### Step 2 - Start the GUI

Open new terminal and run below commands.
```
cd webservice/ui
npm run dev
```

You should see the following message in the terminal.
```
webpack: Compiled successfully
```

### Step 3 - FFmpeg Server

Open new terminal and run the below commands.
```
sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf
```

### Step 4 - Run the code

Open a new terminal to run the code. 

#### Setup the environment

You must configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by running the following command:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5
```

You should also be able to run the application with Python 3.6, although newer versions of Python will not work with the app.

#### Running on the CPU

Though by default application runs on CPU, this can also be explicitly specified by ```-d CPU``` command-line argument:

```
python main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m models/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP32/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

#### Running on the Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2

To run on the Intel® Neural Compute Stick, use the ```-d MYRIAD``` command-line argument:

```
python main.py -d MYRIAD -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m models/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP16/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.

**Note:** The Intel® Neural Compute Stick can only run FP16 models at this time. The model that is passed to the application, through the `-m <path_to_model>` command-line argument, must be of data type FP16.

#### Using a camera stream instead of a video file

To get the input video from the camera, use the `-i CAM` command-line argument. Specify the resolution of the camera using the `-video_size` command line argument.

For example:
```
python main.py -i CAM -m your-model.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.

**Note:**
User has to give `-video_size` command line argument according to the input as it is used to specify the resolution of the video or image file.

## A Note on Running Locally

As such,
to run on your local machine, you will need to change the below file:

```
webservice/ui/src/constants/constants.js
```

The `CAMERA_FEED_SERVER` and `MQTT_SERVER` both use the workspace configuration. 
You can change each of these as follows:

```
CAMERA_FEED_SERVER: "http://localhost:3004"
...
MQTT_SERVER: "ws://localhost:3002"
```
